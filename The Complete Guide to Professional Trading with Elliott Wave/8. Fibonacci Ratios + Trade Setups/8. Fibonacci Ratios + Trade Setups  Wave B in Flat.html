<p>In a Flat kind of correction the Minimum Retracemet that we expect from Wave B is 90% of Wave A.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the above is a general observation of mine and not a hard and fast rule but it has held true in my analysis and trading.</p>





<p>This above observation can help us differentiate between a Flat and a Zig Zag kind of correction in case the internal wave counts are not clear.</p>





<p>To differentiate between a Flat or a Zig Zag kind of correction all we have to do is to draw a retracement of Wave A, now if the price is above the 90% mark then we can assume that the correction is a Flat type of correction, else we shall assume it's a Zig Zag correction.</p>





<p>The 90% mark is a general observation but <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">if Wave B retraces more then 100% of Wave A, that is it moves beyond the starting point of Wave A then it is for sure a Flat kind of a correction</strong>, in such a case we can expect Wave B to retrace maximum uptill the 138.2% Fibonacci level.</p>





<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u> : </strong></p>





<ol><li>If Wave B retraces more then 90% of Wave A then it can be assumed as a Flat correction.</li><li>The maximum target that one should expect from a Flat correction is 138.2% retracement level of Wave A.</li></ol>

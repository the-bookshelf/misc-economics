Conclusion
: Concept of POINT OF REFERENCE 
</p>

<p>
Steps
: 
</p>



<ol>
	<li>
<p>
	We
	open the <strong>monthly
	chart</strong>
	or the highest time frame chart available.</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	We
	make the Wave count and mark the point where a Wave completed on the
	monthly time frame or we determine a significant low point or high
	point and we mark it as the Point of Reference.</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	We
	now move to 1 lower time frame -</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Monthly
	to Weekly time frame</strong>
	
	</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	Now
	from the point marked as Point of Reference we start counting the
	Waves of one lesser degree and the point where the last wave in this
	count gets completed is marked as the new Point of Reference.</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	We
	now shift to further lower time frame -</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Weekly
	to daily </strong>and
	start counting waves from the new Point of Reference.</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	By
	repeating these steps over and over again we can go to time frames
	as low as 1 min. chart but doing so would be too complicated at this
	point.</p>
</li></ol>

Note
– It is advised
that you first practice this concept only  uptill
the 1 Hour time
frame
and later proceed to even  lower time frames, personally I prefer not
to go below the 5 minutes time frame unless there is a specific need
for the same.

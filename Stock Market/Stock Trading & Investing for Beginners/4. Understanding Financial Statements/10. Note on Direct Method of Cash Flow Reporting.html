            <p>In the last video the format in which we showed the cash flows is actually known as the indirect method of cash flow reporting. Another method of cash flow reporting is the direct method. In the direct method the cash flow from operating activities is reported in a different format. However the format for cash flow from investing activities and financing activities doesn't change. In this lecture we describe the direct method of cash flow reporting.</p>

<p>There are two acceptable formats for reporting cash flow from operating activities. The amount of operating cash flow is identical under both methods; only the presentation format of operating cash flow section differs. </p>



<p>The direct method shows the specific cash inflows and outflows that result in reported cash flow from operating activities. It shows each cash inflow and outflow related to a company's cash receipts &amp; disbursements. The primary advantage of this format is that it provides specific information on specific sources of operating cash receipts and payments. In contrast in the indirect method, only the net result of these receipts and payments is shown.</p>



<p>The indirect method shows how cash flow from operations is obtained from reported net income after making a series of adjustments. Hence the indirect format begins with net income. In order to reconcile net income with operating cash flow, adjustments are made for non cash items, for non-operating items and for net change in operating accruals. Thus indirect approach shows the reason for difference between net income and operating cash flows.</p>



<p>Companies have the choice of choosing between the direct &amp; indirect method for cash flow reporting based on the accounting standards followed in the country.</p>

<p>As you see by looking at this snapshot it is easy to see that the company received 67358 as cash from customers. It paid around 46198 to its suppliers &amp; employees. In the period it also received dividend of 100 from its investments. Cash paid as Interest &amp; financial expenses was 2170. The company also paid taxes of 2942. Thus the net cash from operating activities was 16148. Hence the company generated positive cash from its operations.

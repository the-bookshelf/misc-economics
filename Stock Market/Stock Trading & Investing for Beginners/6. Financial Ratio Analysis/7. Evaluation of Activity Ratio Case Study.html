            <p>Z Company is hypothetical manufacturing company.As part of analysis of management's operating efficiency the following activity ratios are calculated:</p>

<p>Ratio                                                        2009           2008             2007            2006</p>



<p>DOH                                                        35.68          40.70            40.47           48.51</p>



<p>DSO                                                        45.07          58.28            51.27           76.98</p>



<p>Total Asset Turnover                               0.36             0.28              0.23             0.22</p>



<p>The trend in ratios show that company has improved all ratios over the period. It appears to be managing inventory more efficiently, is collecting receivables faster, and is generating higher level of revenues relative to total assets. This all appears good. But so far you have only determined what happened. It is more important to know why have the ratios improved, because that is how you can judge the company's future performance. </p>



<p>If on examining the financial statements one finds that in fourth quarter of 2009 company recorded an allowance for decline in market value and obsolesce of inventory of about 15% of year end inventory compared to 6% allowance for the previous year. This reduction in value of inventory accounts for a large portion of decline in DOH from 40.70 in 2008 to 35.68 in 2009.Meanwhile if management claims that inventory obsolescence is a short term issue then you should watch DOH in future periods to confirm this assertion.</p>



<p>More positive interpretations can be drawn from the total asset turnover. If you find that company's revenue increased from more than 35 percent while total assets increased only by about 6 percent.Based on external information on industry and economy, you may attribute the increased revenue to overall growth in the industry and to the company's increased market share. Management was able to achieve growth in revenues with a comparatively modest increase in assets, leading to an improvement in total asset turnover.</p>

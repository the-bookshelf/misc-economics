<p>In the previous lectures I discussed the ways in which we can calculate the Targets for Wave 5&nbsp;and the Minimum Target that was coming out for SPX&nbsp;was 2500.&nbsp;</p><p>S&P achieved the level of 2500 on 15th September 2017 and even exceeded the same and is still continuing higher as of today (30/10/2017).</p><p><strong>It is worth noting that the time at which the 2500 target was projected for SPX it was trading around&nbsp;2102 and hence has seen a gain of more then 400 points (more then&nbsp;18.93%) since then.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2017-10-30_13-46-42-718cab94eb5a6070a9516a4c280b0a39.png" data-s3="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2017-10-30_13-46-42-718cab94eb5a6070a9516a4c280b0a39.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p>

            <p>In most stock markets around the world, thousands of stocks are available for an investor to choose from. Thus it may become difficult to figure out which stock to analyze. If you are like most investors you may follow one or more of the following strategies:</p><p>1. Randomly picks stocks and start performing fundamental / technical analysis</p><p>2. Pick stocks of companies whose products you have used.</p><p>3. Pick stocks of companies whose advertisements you come across on various media</p><p>4. Rely on brokerages and discussion forums to give you stock ideas that you then analyze yourself.</p><p>In the last few lectures you have seen a variety of financial ratios. These ratios can not only be used to analyze a stock you are interested in, but also to create stock screens which is essentially a filtered down list of stocks. Essentially you can create a filter based on certain parameters using the various financial ratios we have discussed. The filter is run on all the stocks in the stock market and a list of stocks is created that meet each of the parameters specified by the user. Using this strategy can narrow down your options considerably. Creating such filters also helps you to discover stocks with strong fundamentals that you may have otherwise not heard of.</p><p>For example you can create a filter by combining the following parameters:</p><p>1. Price to Earnings Ratio &lt; 15 ( Since P/E of less than 15 may indicate a stock that is not over valued)</p><p>2. Debt to Equity &lt; 0.5 (To select companies with low debt)</p><p>3. Return on Total Capital &gt; 20% ( To select companies which are generating substantial returns on the employed capital).</p><p>By combining 2 &amp; 3 you are also selecting companies who are generating substantial returns on their own capital, which would also imply that they may be generating substantial cash to sustain their growth. </p><p>4. Operating Cash Flow &gt; 0</p><p>5. Price to Book Value &lt; 1.5 (A figure recommended by Benjamin Graham)</p><p>So for example by combining these parameters and running a filter you can get a narrowed down list of stocks. You can now proceed to analyzing individual stocks from this list one by one. If the list is too broad you may add additional parameters to narrow it down further. For example instead of using debt to equity &lt; 0.5, you can look at debt free companies by adding a parameter that says Debt = 0.</p><p>There are a variety of stock screener websites that may be available in your country, which you can use to create filters using the financial ratios you have learned in this section. Yahoo also provides a basic stock screener which can be accessed <a href="https://screener.finance.yahoo.com/stocks.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><br></p>

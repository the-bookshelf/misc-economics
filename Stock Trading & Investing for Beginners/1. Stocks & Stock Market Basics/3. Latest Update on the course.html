            <p>Thank You for taking this course. This course has received new updates recently. I have redone the videos for section 1,2 &amp; 3 in order to create a better learning experience for you. I hope you like it.</p>

<p>In case you feel any issues with the new videos (or any other issue for that matter) please feel free to message me directly so that I can immediately fix it for you.</p>







<p>In case you would like to view the older version of videos from section 1,2 &amp; 3, they are still available towards the end of the course (last 3 sections).</p><p>I would be really grateful if you can leave a rating/ review when you feel comfortable.</p>



<p>Happy Learning!<br></p>
